CSNA3 Stock Price Prediction Model

Overview
This repository contains the Python code for a deep learning model designed to predict buy and sell signals for the CSNA3 stock (Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional). 
The model leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to analyze historical stock price data and generate trading signals.

Features
- Data Processing: Scripts for loading, cleaning, and transforming stock price data.
- Model Training: LSTM-based neural network setup, training with historical data.
- Prediction: Generation of buy and sell signals based on the trained model.
- Backtesting: Implementation of a trading strategy based on model predictions and calculation of potential returns.
- Analysis: Detailed visualization of model accuracy and trading strategy effectiveness.
